Hello Everyone! 👋

I began 2025 quite optimistic and ready to take on the opportunities and challenges that would come my way. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned — I hope you can relate. 😅

I faced certain challenges beyond my control. But now, it’s time to pick up from where I left off. 🚀

🌟 Starting Today: I’m embarking on a 24-day project timeline — from ideation to deployment.

📅 Today marks Day 1 of this exciting journey!

I invite you to join me on this path of consistency and persistence, where I:

Correct my past mistakes 🔧

Grow to become better than I was yesterday 🌱

Stay true to myself and contribute positively to society 🌍

✨ I’m kicking things off with this GitHub repository — complete with a detailed README that outlines the entire project brief.

Let’s build something meaningful together! 💻💡
